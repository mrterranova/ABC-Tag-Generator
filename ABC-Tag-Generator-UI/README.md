# Automatc Book Categorization Tag Generator Frontend (React)

## Overview

This React application serves as the frontend interface for the **ABC Tag Generator API**. It allows users to input book-related information and receive a predicted category generated by a machine learning model hosted behind a secure API.

The frontend communicates with an express API which contains the logic to call on the machine learning API and display predicted category values and probabilities based on the user's query.

## Routing and Navigation

Client-side routing is handled using React Router. This allows users to navigate between pages without full page reloads, creating a smoother user experience.

The navigation bar provides links to:
- Home
- Categorization form
- Search
- Reports
- Next steps

Programmatic navigation is used via react-router package where appropriate (ie, buttons that redirect users to specific pages).


## Features

- User-friendly form for book information input
- Sends requests to a protected backend API
- Displays predicted book category results
- Uses environment variables for API configuration
- Designed to be lightweight and deployable on free hosting platforms

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API using HTTP requests to:

1. Submit book data for categorization
2. Retrieve categorized results
3. Perform searches and reporting tasks

This separation ensures the UI remains lightweight while all processing and data handling occur on the server.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**
- **Typescript**
- **Fetch API** for HTTP requests
- **Environment Variables** for API configuration

Setup Tooling:
- Create React App
-  Netlify (deployment env)

```

## Development Workflow

The React application is developed and run independently from the backend:

```
cd ABC-Tag-Generator-UI
npm install
npm run dev
```

During development, the UI runs on a local development server and communicates with the backend via API endpoints.

## Build and Deployment

For production, the frontend is compiled into static assets using:
```
npm run build
```

This generates an optimized build that can be deployed to any static hosting service or served by the backend.

## Summary

The React frontend provides a clean, user-friendly interface that connects users to the ABC Tag Generator’s backend and machine learning services. By separating the UI into its own application, the project achieves better maintainability, scalability, and flexibility for future enhancements.
